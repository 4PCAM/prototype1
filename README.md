# **4-PCAM: Patient-Centric Ayurvedic Management System**

## **Overview**

The 4-PCAM system is a web-based tool designed to assist Ayurvedic practitioners in assessing patient health according to core Ayurvedic principles. The application is structured into four main assessment modules: Patient Information, Dosha Dusti (Dosha Imbalance), Agni Dusti (Digestive Fire Imbalance), and Dhatu Dusti (Tissue Imbalance).

This project uses a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript stack to provide a clean, responsive, and intuitive user interface for data entry and assessment.

## **Features**

* **Patient Information:** A dedicated page (index.html) for collecting and managing essential patient details.  
* **Dosha Dusti Assessment:** A comprehensive assessment module (dosha-dusti.html) to evaluate the imbalance of Vata, Pitta, and Kapha doshas.  
* **Agni Dusti Assessment:** A module (agni-dusti.html) for assessing the state of the patient's Agni, or digestive fire.  
* **Dhatu Dusti Assessment:** A detailed assessment page (dhatu-dusti.html) to identify imbalances within the seven Dhatus (body tissues).  
* **Responsive Design:** The interface is built to be accessible and easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.  
* **Auto-Save Functionality:** Data is automatically saved locally in the browser to prevent data loss.  
* **Progress Tracking:** The application tracks the completion of each assessment module, providing a clear overview of the patient's case progress.

## **Technology Stack**

* **Frontend:**  
  * HTML5  
  * CSS3 (with linear gradients and modern layouts)  
  * JavaScript (for logic, data management, and interactivity)
